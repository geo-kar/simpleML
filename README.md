# simpleML
A simple machine learning algorithm for image classification written with cpp.


The algoritm works using a dataset of photos of different shapes and train with
them using 10 SVMs for each type.

Using the function createVocabulary we build our databese shaped vocabulary.

Then we run again the algorith in order to "train" using the training part of the source code.

At the end we run the final function which classifies an example set of images and it displays the 
success rate of the algorithm.


!!!The algoritm is not finalised and needs optimisation in order to have better success rate!!!
